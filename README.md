# BitTorrent protocol implementation

#### First real program written in node
It takes a torrent file of <b>single file structure</b> and downloads it. 

### Improvements
Program needs a lot of improvements:
<ul>
    <li>Support for multiple files torrent file structure</li>
    <li>Bunch of other stuff that I can't remember right now</li>
    <li>Reafactor code to have somekind of logical design</li>
</ul>
